Hi there! My name is Jason and I'm a software developer based in Hamilton, Ontario.

I'm a recent grad of <a href="https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link">Mohawk College</a> of the Software Development Program. I love building web and mobile applications that are a pleasure to use and bring value to people's lives.

Although I value flexibility and can be deployed to most roles, full-stack development is the current focus for my goals.

Everyday I try to work on meaningful and interesting projects or learn something new.
